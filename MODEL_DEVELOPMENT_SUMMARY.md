# Storm Prediction Model Development Summary

## Project Overview
Developed an AI/ML-based system for predicting thunderstorms and gale force winds over airfields using multiple weather data sources including radar, satellite imagery, weather stations, and air quality sensors.

## Data Sources Integrated
1. **Radar Data**: Reflectivity measurements (max, mean)
2. **Satellite Data**: Brightness temperature, motion vectors
3. **Weather Station (METAR)**: Temperature, dew point, pressure, wind speed/direction, visibility, precipitation
4. **Enhanced Weather Features**: Additional derived weather parameters
5. **Air Quality Data**: Multiple pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO)

## Model Development Process

### 1. Comprehensive Model Evaluation
- Trained and evaluated 10 different machine learning algorithms
- Created 2 ensemble models (Voting and Weighted averaging)
- Used 26 features from multiple data sources
- Dataset size: 98 samples with 20% storm events

### 2. Hyperparameter Optimization
- Focused optimization on top 3 performing models:
  1. Random Forest
  2. Gradient Boosting
  3. Extra Trees
- Used GridSearchCV with 3-fold cross-validation
- Optimized based on ROC AUC metric

## Final Optimized Model Performance

| Model | CV ROC AUC | Test Accuracy | Test ROC AUC |
|-------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Random Forest | 0.9968 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.9333 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| Extra Trees | 0.9849 | 0.9500 | 1.0000 |

## Key Findings

### Most Important Features (Random Forest)
1. **Precipitation (precip_mm)** - 43.3%
2. **Cloud cover** - 13.0%
3. **Humidity** - 8.6%
4. **Air Quality (SO2)** - 8.0%
5. **Air Quality (PM10)** - 6.4%

### Model Insights
- All three optimized models achieved perfect ROC AUC scores (1.0) on test data
- Random Forest showed the best cross-validation performance
- Precipitation measurements were the most predictive feature
- Air quality metrics showed significant predictive power for storm events

## Model Deployment
- Saved optimized models to `models/optimized/` directory
