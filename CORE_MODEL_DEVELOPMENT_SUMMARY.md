3. **Weather Stations (METAR)**: Temperature, pressure, wind, visibility
4. **Enhanced Weather Features**: Derived parameters
5. **Air Quality Data**: Pollution measurements

### Data Processing
- Merged 5 data sources into a unified dataset
- Handled missing values using median imputation
- Resampled to consistent 5-minute intervals
- Dataset size: 98 samples with 26 features
